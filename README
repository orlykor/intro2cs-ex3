EXERCISE 9:
1. the difference between exercise 7 and 8 is that in 7 we do it in modulo 2 and in 8 we do it in modulo 10.moreover, when we do it in the 8th exercise the order is the opposite unless we change it. 
for ex- when we convert binary num into decimal the order is right- 1100
we get 12 in the correct order. but when we go from decimal to binary we get the nums not in the right order. for ex we get from the num 2 the binary num 01 which is 1 in decimal. so we need to change it in the end to get it right.

2. the min change we need to do is to change the modulo from 2 to 10, and the order we write the sum in the 8th exercise- that way it writes it correctly. and instead of divine 2 to get the binary num we do the opposite to get to the decimal number.

3.  a. in order to go beetwen bases we need to go first to base 10 and then from there go to the other bases. 
for ex, if we want to go from 6 to 2 we need to do bigger changes, we need to ass both programs- first, go to 10 base, then go "down" to base 2.
anf for going from 4 to 10, we can use program 7, with a few changes- instead of doing 2**0 doing it with 4. 

yes he can. he put the number, then every num the user puts the program turns it into decimal base, then convert it to the chosen base.
